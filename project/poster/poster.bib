   abstract = {To better understand the challenges in developing
     effective cloud-based resource schedulers, we analyze the first
     publicly available trace data from a sizable multi-purpose cluster.
     The most notable workload characteristic is heterogeneity: in
     resource types (e.g., cores:RAM per machine) and their usage
     (e.g., duration and resources needed). Such heterogeneity reduces
     the effectiveness of traditional slot- and core-based scheduling.
     Furthermore, some tasks are constrained as to the kind of machine
     types they can use, increasing the complexity of resource assignment
     and complicating task migration. The workload is also highly
     dynamic, varying over time and most workload features, and is
     driven by many short jobs that demand quick scheduling decisions.
     While few simplifying assumptions apply, we find that many
     longer-running jobs have relatively stable resource utilizations,
     which can help adaptive resource schedulers.},

abstract     = {<p>This paper reexamines the rules of thumb for the design of data storage
                systems. Briefly, it looks at storage, processing, and networking costs, ratios,
                and trends with a particular focus on performance and price/performance. Amdahl's
                ratio laws for system design need only slight revision after 35 years-the major
                change being the increased use of RAM. An analysis also indicates storage should
                be used to cache both database and Web data to save disk bandwidth, network
                bandwidth, and people's time. Surprisingly, the 5-minute rule for disk caching
                becomes a cache-everything rule for Web caching.</p>},
