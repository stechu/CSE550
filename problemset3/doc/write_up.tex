\section{Introduction}

TODO: some intro stuff

\section{Performance Evaluation}

\subsection{Raw Performance}

TODO: insert graph with computation time scalability with larger dat

TODO: execution time decrease with increase in number of nodes

\subsection{Performance Breakdown}

TODO: why does our performance curve look like it does

TODO: what scalability barriers does our implementation encounter

\subsection{Analytics Platform Evaluation}

TODO: was platform a good fit for analytics application?

TODO: if our analytics suck, why?

\section{Throughput Per Hour}

TODO: how do we do?
